# DeadTrees - Dead Tree Detection
A computer vision system for detecting dead trees using multi-spectral imagery (RGB + NIR). This project implements three distinct approaches:

## Approaches
- **Traditional Image Segmentation**​​: Handcrafted features with threshold-based classification

- **​​Machine Learning**​​: Ensemble model combining SVM and XGBoost, plus Random Forest

- **Deep Learning​​**: UNet and ECA-UNet architectures with various loss functions

## Key Features
- **Multi-modal data processing (RGB + NIR images)**

- **Comprehensive feature extraction (spectral, texture, spatial features)**

- **Multiple model architectures for comparison**

- **Full evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, IoU)**

## Results
- **Comparative analysis of all methods provided in detailed performance reports.**

- **For detailed implementation and results, see the Jupyter notebook and project report.**
